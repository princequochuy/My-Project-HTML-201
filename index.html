                            Born Shanbao (Shan-pao; ÂñÑ‰øù), his given name was later changed to Heshen. His courtesy name was Zhizhai (Chih-chai; Ëá¥ÈΩã). He was a member of the

                        <p>
                            Heshen was born as the son of a Manchu military officer and was selected to go to the most privileged school for Manchu aristocratic boys. He lost his mother when he was young and it was said he and his younger brother had a hard life under his stepmother. However, it was reported that Heshen was an excellent student, knowing several languages including Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca), Manchu, Mongolian and Tibetan.

                            In 1772, he began work in the Imperial Palace, assigned as an imperial bodyguard and was stationed at the gates to the Forbidden City. As an official, he is remembered as the most corrupt official in Chinese history, acquiring for himself over his career property worth 1,100 million taels of silver, equal to roughly ü§ë<span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: green;">270 billion dollars (USD)</span>ü§ë.

                            From the 24 years that Heshen caught the Qianlong Emperor's attention and favor, he had amassed an incredible fortune. In the Jiaqing Emperor's confiscation of Heshen's property, his wealth estate included:
